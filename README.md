 This C programming project is a simple bus reservation system. Here's a quick overview:

1. Main Function: The program starts with a main function that acts as a menu-driven interface for users. Users can view bus lists, book tickets, cancel bookings, check bus status, and exit the system.

2. Bus Function: Displays a list of available bus routes.

3. Booking Function: Allows users to book tickets for a specific bus route. Reads and updates seat availability from corresponding text files. Takes passenger details like name and seat number.

4. Name_Number Function: Handles the input of passenger names and seat numbers during the booking process. Writes this information to text files for later retrieval.

5. Read_Number and Read_Name Functions:Read seat numbers and passenger names from the respective text files based on the bus route.

6. Status and Status_1 Functions:Displays the current status of booked seats for a specific bus.Status_1 is used during the booking process to show the initial status.

7. Cancel Function:Allows users to cancel a booked ticket.Updates seat availability and removes passenger information from files.

8. Printing Function (Unused):Appears to be a duplicate of the cancel function.

9. Login Function:Implements a basic login system with a hardcoded username and password ("Alex" and "db638ee1" in this case).

10. Overall: Uses file handling to store and retrieve seat numbers and passenger names. Seat availability and passenger details are stored in separate text files for each bus route.
